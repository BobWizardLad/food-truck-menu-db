# food-truck-menu-db
Final project for a Database course serving information on menu items, employees, and sales.

# The Project
Project draws from a (now dead) database to serve information through an html page using PHP and the Java sql library. The project files include some rough plans for the
realized end result, some provided example code referenced for the project, Database definitions, default information to populate the database with, some database functions,
and the Java and HTML/PHP that makes it all work. A project report is also included that has further information and images of the website live.
